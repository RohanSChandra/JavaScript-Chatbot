# Java Script Chat Bot (Game Bot)

This was a project provided by Developers Institute and some boiler code was provided. I coded the logic and designed the basic UI for this, the outcome of this was to demonstrate my knowledge on using `Jest` and being able to write vanilla `Javascript`. The aim of this Chat Bot is to determine what Game you would like to play and then it would link you to the Games reviews for you to make the decision. There are 2 paths for each question with a flow chart detailing all questions.
